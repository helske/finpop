# Data and codes for *Bayesian reconstruction of historical population in Finland 1647-1850*

This repository contains data, model file and scripts for estimating the Finnish population in 1647-1850 as in paper Voutilainen, Helske, HÃ¶gmander (2019), *Bayesian reconstruction of historical population in Finland 1647-1850*, to appear in Demography.

The final model is defined in file `population_model.stan` and the corresponding `R` script is in `population_model.R`. File `results.R` was used to draw figures and compute the summary statistics presented in the paper. Note that the main output file `fit_population_model.R` from the modelling is not available at Github as the file size is over 80GB. However, the posterior samples of time-invariant hyperparameters are in file `sims.rds`.
